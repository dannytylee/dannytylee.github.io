                        <p>I am currently a second-year (senior*) studying mathematics, economics, and data science at UC San Diego where I am expected to graduate Spring of 2025. Apart from my ongoing activities performing data analysis for PhD students and mentoring robotics in my local community, I was a Innovating for National Security (Hacking for Defense - H4D) intern where I developed a comprehensive commercialization plan and provided strategic recommendations to National Guard Bureau leaders. My H4D experience has expanded my perspectives to different industries, sectors, and types of work, which has led me to participate in various diversity professional programs such as ModernGuild's Consulting Accelerator and the Goldman Sachs Virtual Insight Series. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In the future, I hope to pursue all things innovation – getting to understand problems with existing systems and processes, interviewing different people involved, and building products that will deliver value to its users. I see conducting data analysis, generating relevant insights, and visualizing trends and results to be in the same vein, both revolving around a theme of problem-solving, changemaking, and storytelling.
                        </p>

                        <p>In my free time, I like to read literature on behavioral science and persuasive technology, go thrifting or antique hunting, learn Japanese, and keep up with various designers and illustrators I’ve followed over the years. I am also an avid viewer of many live streamers and YouTubers, and a listener of their podcasts. I recently bought my first film camera, which I think I will be using a lot!
                        </p>
